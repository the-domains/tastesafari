I used to be the pickiest of eaters. Meat on bones. Tropical fruits. Artificial cheese. I basically just lived on instant ramen, pizza, and cheeseburgers. When I was a vegetarian, I just endless amounts of pasta.

This all changed in 2004, when I went on a Pop Japan Travel tour to Japan. In Tokyo, there's a place called Namja Town, which is a cat theme park that takes up a couple floors of a building. The top level has a bunch of ice cream shops, and one of the shops has every flavor ice cream ever invented. If I remember right, Kim egged me on to eat the horse ice cream, and I did. It was terrible.

The next day, Aka-san took us to a rotating sushi boat place, and I was encouraged by the group to eat the raw horse meat sushi because I'd had the ice cream the day before. It was pretty good, and I ate a piece of whale afterwards.

That's really what started this weird obsession with food exploration, and re-training my taste buds to accept new things. I'll try anything at least once.
